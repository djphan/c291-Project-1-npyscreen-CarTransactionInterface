COMMUNICATION / NOTES     |
__________________________|
!!! Test cases are up:
https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/mod/page/view.php?id=998610
We will have to alter some things to comply with these new requirements. Nothing too major though.

TO DO:
 	driver_search.py            <--- done
 	vehicle_history_search.py
 	violation_search.py         <--- Jon (near completion)
 	
If you want to work on one of them please make a note here so we don't end up doing the same thing twice.

Other TO-DO's:
  Finish error checking/validation for:
    ViolationRecord
    DriverLicence       <-- Jon will finish Monday with TA(BLOB issue)
    NewVehicleRegistration?? (at least mostly done) <-- Jon (near completion)
  Fix BLOB uploading                <-- Jon will discuss with TA on Monday
  
  <add other TODO's here if you have any>
A people entry form must be created. The user should be forwarded here
when they are entering data re a person that does not exist.
