COMMUNICATION / NOTES     |

CARL:
Added dummy forms in SearchEngine, in files:
 	driver_search.py
 	vehicle_history_search.py
 	violation_search.py
 	
If you want to work on one of them please make a note here so we don't end up doing the same thing twice.

Other TO-DO's:
  Finish error checking/validation for:
    ViolationRecord
    DriverLicence
    NewVehicleRegistration?? (at least mostly done)
  Fix BLOB uploading
  
  <add other TODO's here if you have any>
