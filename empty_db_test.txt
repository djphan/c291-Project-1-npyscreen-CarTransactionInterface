------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario 1. No issues found.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario 2: Registering officer: auto transaction.
1)
Sellers are not being removed from db on transactions.

<Carl>: Same for me... I can't figure out why that's happening though.
        The code to do so is in there. :/
<Jon>: :( I will start looking into all the errors once I'm done a once through
        of the tests. 

vehicle serial number is case sensitive not sure if we should change this.







------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario 3: Driver Registering Officer: Driver Licence Reg
1)
Fixed a few minor things.
Everything else here seems good.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario 4: Police Officer: Violation Record
1) violation record crashes on entry with empty tables.

Fixed small issue but This has not yet been thoroughly tested.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenarion 5: searches
<Jon>: fixed back button issue using Carl form.

<Dan>: Note the esc function is only working in Driver Search. Not Q. It hasn't been ported to the
other search modules

1) Found a weird issue on on driver search, I have 3 people licenced in total
2 are named Jon, 1 is named Jim, when I search by the name Jon, I am getting 3
results instead of 2. The licence number of the first 2 results are paired 
accurately with the appropriate name but in the 3rd result that should not be 
there no licence number is present, I get N/A.

I can't seem to break any of the other searches so we should be good here.
