Scenario 1. No issues found.







Scenario 2: Registering officer: auto transaction.
1)
Sellers are not being removed from db on transactions.

<Carl>: Same for me... I can't figure out why that's happening though.
        The code to do so is in there. :/
<Jon>: :( I will start looking into all the errors once I'm done a once through
        of the tests. 


Scenario 3: Driver Registering Officer: Driver Licence Reg
1)
When registering a new drivers licence you are taken back
to the main menu. Not sure if this is ok. Nitpicking but 
each scenario specifies explicitly when it should go back 
to the main menu so may be worth changing.

<Carl>: Yes I agree that should be changed.

Everything else here seems good.


Scenario 4: Police Officer: Violation Record
1) violation record crashes on entry with empty tables.

<Carl>: One of you changed the MAX statement in auto_transaction... 
        Probably this is the same bug here?
<Jon>: I changed it, will do the same here once im done testing.


Scenarion 5: searches
*** I have no back in driver search.
