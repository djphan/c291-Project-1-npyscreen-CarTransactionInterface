Scenario 1. No issues found.







Scenario 2: Registering officer: auto transaction.
1)
Sellers are not being removed from db on transactions.




Scenario 3: Driver Registering Officer: Driver Licence Reg
1)
When registering a new drivers licence you are taken back
to the main menu. Not sure if this is ok. Nitpicking but 
each scenario specifies explicitly when it should go back 
to the main menu so may be worth changing.

Everything else here seems good.


Scenario 4: Police Officer: Violation Record
1) violation record crashes on entry with empty tables.
