Remaining issues from tests:

Scenarion 5: searches

<Dan>: Note the esc function is only working in Driver Search. Not Q. It hasn't been ported to the
other search modules

1) Found a weird issue on on driver search, I have 3 people licenced in total
2 are named Jon, 1 is named Jim, when I search by the name Jon, I am getting 3
results instead of 2. The licence number of the first 2 results are paired 
accurately with the appropriate name but in the 3rd result that should not be 
there no licence number is present, I get N/A.
