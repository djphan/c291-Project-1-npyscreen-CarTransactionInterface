Scenario 1. No issues found.







Scenario 2: Registering officer: auto transaction.
1)
Sellers are not being removed from db on transactions.

<Carl>: Same for me... I can't figure out why that's happening though.
        The code to do so is in there. :/
<Jon>: :( I will start looking into all the errors once I'm done a once through
        of the tests. 


Scenario 3: Driver Registering Officer: Driver Licence Reg
1)
Fixed a few minor things.
Everything else here seems good.


Scenario 4: Police Officer: Violation Record
1) violation record crashes on entry with empty tables.

<Carl>: One of you changed the MAX statement in auto_transaction... 
        Probably this is the same bug here?
<Jon>: I changed it, will do the same here once im done testing.


Scenarion 5: searches
*** I have no back in driver search. Tab/arrow controls are wonky.

1) Found a weird issue on on driver search, I have 3 people licenced in total
2 are named Jon, 1 is named Jim, when I search by the name Jon, I am getting 3
results instead of 2. The licence number of the first 2 results are paired 
accurately with the appropriate name but in the 3rd result that should not be 
there no licence number is present, I get N/A.


I can't seem to break any of the other searches so we should be good here.
